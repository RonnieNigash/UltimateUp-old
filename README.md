We want to attract more people to play Frisbee. There are two barriers to entry in Frisbee game: people don't know where to play it, and people hesitate when they don't know how to play.

We are building a phone App sharing location of Frisbee to get people involved. We have attached a Relayr Wunderbar on a Frisbee, the sensors gives us data about the acceleration and gyroscopic values. We have made a website to demonstrate each throw's result.  http://ultimateup.azurewebsites.net/ We consider the weather as a factor in the performance using the Wunderground API. Later we will analysis the curve of the Frisbee and keep track of how you perform when you are tossing. These features can bring Frisbee players closer together.

As for incoming Frisbee player, we are building an auto correct Frisbee for them. We want poor throws to be balanced and fly smoothly. In order to do that, we are using Intel Edison as the controller to control a servo to control the center of mass. We can take the measurement from gyroscope and have a closed loop control to the servo.

Frisbee is simple. All you need is a disc, a friend and a field. And we believe we need to enhance the greatest of Frisbee to have a product that is simple, accessible, and social. We will build an App with minimum steps, ship a Smart Frisbee with low cost, and build a welcoming community to let more people play.
